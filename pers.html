                    <p>This a networking project I started recently. It includes two raspbery PI(3B+ & 4 both of which
                        are running on raspberrian OS), and a scrapped PC. Full specs of each will be further
                        down the page.

                            <h2><span class="jumbDisp"></span> DNS Ad Sinkhole</h2>
                            <p>One of the servers running on the 3B+ is a DNS ad sinkhole known as 'PI-Hole'. Runnning
                                PI-Hole
                                on my LAN under a static DHCP which then allows me to set my DNS as Pi-Hole. When a
                                client
                                connects to my server, it first makes the DNS request. This request is now sent to my
                                Pi-hole
                                instead of the automatically assigned DNS. After this point there are several conditions
                                that
                                have to be met inorder for returns.
                                If itâ€™s a blocked domain sends the request, the returned IP address is 0.0.0.0 and the
                                request
                                ends there.
                                Else (it's not a blocked domain), the DNS request is forwarded to an upstream server,
                                and
                                Pi-hole returns the
                                final response to the client. Then the client connects to the server.
                                This leaves me with ad free pages on all devices connected to the #B+ DNS on my network.
                                The
                                spaces where ads would be are filled with empty space or if video ads they are skipped
                                completely.

                                <p> In addition to the pi-Hole there is also a VPN that is paired with it. There were a

                                    different ones I wanted to try but OpenVPN was the only one that I came across that

                                <p> Currently there is an FTP server also on the 3B+. This functions pretty well with
                                    1TB of
                                    storage. Files on here are then stored on another 1TB drive which is connected to
                                    the
                                    PLEX media server. Allowing me or my family to watch and listen to all the media
                                    uploaded to the FTP.

                                    In the near future this set up will change because its extremely inefficent. Insead
                                    of
                                    the FTP I will be making an NAS. I will use the PI4 and the scrapped PC. The Pi4
                                    will be
                                    using Samba to share with the PI4. In addition, I will have a RAID-0 set up for the
                                    previous 2x 1TB SSDs which will leave rougly 2TB of storage. This will add a more
                                    seamless access of data between machines and even the PLEX server.
